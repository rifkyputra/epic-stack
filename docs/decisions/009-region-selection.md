# Region Selection

Date: 2023-06-02

Status: accepted

## Context

## Decision

Ask which region the app should be deployed to during setup.

## Consequences

Forces the developer to make a choice (goes against the "Minimize Setup
Friction" guiding principle). However, we can make it slightly better by
defaulting to the region that's closest to the developer.
